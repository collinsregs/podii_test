Details Screen: A screen that displays the details of a selected item, including the name, image, etc.

Styling: The app uses custom colors, fonts, and images to make the app look visually appealing.

Responsive Design: The app looks good on both mobile and tablet devices.

The app uses the following widgets and concepts:

​

MaterialApp and Scaffold widgets for the app structure.

StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget widgets for building the UI.

ListView and ListTile widgets for displaying the list of snacks.
